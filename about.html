    <p>
        Dear Recruiter,<br>
       <p>I am seeking a new career in Web Development. I am studying Full Stack Web Development through a self-taught route using <br>
        <b>Freecodecamp.org, YouTube: Harvard Computer Science course, MIT, a guy named BroCode,<br>
        and Udemy: Web Development Bootcamp by AppBrewery.</b><br></p>        
        <p>Online learning has been challenging without the instructor in front of me, which is my learning style,<br>
        which is why I have used several resources.</p>       
        <p>I am good at researching. I like to be challenged, I am highly organized,<br>
        detail oriented, I naturally see patterns, efficiencies and in-efficiencies.<br>
        I am reliable, dependant, self motivated and work well in a team or alone.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking your time looking over my projects and resume.<br>
        I look forward to hearing from you.<br>
        </p>           
        Sincerly,<br>
        Ginny Carr
