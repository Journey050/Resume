Thank you for visiting my portofolio.
I have enjoyed computers since I first learned to type. Though life had other plans
I'm finally on the course to doing what I love and what my brain thrives to do, problem solving,
creating, designing, being detail oriented, and continous learning.
I love to road bike because I can push myself mentally to do what is hard or may appear hard 
yet when I'm done there is a thrill of accomplishment. That is how I look at working in computers, 
mentally pusing through the difficult to see the results.
I hope that you enjoy looking over this portfolio. 
Sincerely,
Ginny Carr
